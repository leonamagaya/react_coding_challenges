# Profile Card

A basic profile card that shows:
* The name of the developer.
* A brief introduction
* Their skills

Key learning concepts were:
* Components: components rules, components trees, creating components, styling components.
* Props : passing data from parent components to child components.
* Separation of concerns in React: how each component is concerned with one piece of UI containing the data, logic and appearance.
